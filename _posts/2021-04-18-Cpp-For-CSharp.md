title: C++ for C# Programmers
---

In my teenage years I was introduced to learn programming in Basic. Soon I needed something that is more advanced, and the choices were C or Pascal. The choice went to Pascal because I found C was too complex, for example they used `char[]` when they meant `string`, etc.. This stigma grew by hearing that the memory management in C or C++ was horrible and wild, it was too easy to make a misake and leak some memory. 

In the year 2020, I was challanged (better said: get the opportunity) to use C++ in at work. The advantage of these kinds situation is that, you are not starting the application from scratch, so that you are able to see various language features at instance. Also you're backed up by your colleagues as your seniors, mentors, tutors, it was perfect!

After some while using C++, I realized that it was not the same C/C++ I saw. The memory management is very good, when you use it in a correct manner, there are a lot of good practices to enforce this. The language itself grows from time to time, we're talking about *lamda functions*, *functions as 1st class citizen*, *auto* (similar to `var` in C#), and a lot more. Albeit C++ doesn't grow as fast as C#, I would consider it still as a modern programming language.

This motivates me to write a blog series *C++ for C# Programmers*, also to motivate others to enrich their skill. Just as I am a C# programmer who start learning C++, there are certain concepts that might be similar or different from C#. I will explain what are similar and different, so that you can learn it efficiently. As I still learn it myself, I'm hoping that we can also teach each other, by exchanging experiences.
