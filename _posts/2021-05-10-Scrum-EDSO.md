title: How Scrum Boosts Your Happiness Hormones
---

I borrow this idea from Simon Sinek&#39;s Leaders Eat Last (chapter 6) and translate it into Scrum framework.

**1)Endorphins** turn the physical pain into joy, like when you&#39;re training for your next kick-box match. All the push-ups, all the kicking and getting punches. And even on the match itself, when you&#39;re not really in shape anymore, but there&#39;s a push to knock-down the opponent and ignoring the pain you suffer at the moment.

Scrum is designed to have a small cycle, where the team plan the work for a short time, like for the coming 2 weeks. We call this cycle a _sprint,_ yes, we&#39;re running a short distance for as fast as we can. Just like a sprinter that sees the finish line 100m ahead, ignoring anything else. I bet he&#39;ll ignore all the pain and suffer he experiences just to get the 100m finished.

So does in Scrum, we set the goal for the coming 2 weeks that&#39;s usually a small increment, and we will do anything to get it done as fast as we can. There might be impediments (the pains) but the focus remains to finish the planned jobs.

**2)Dopamine** shots are released when you feel that you have accomplished something. Scrum framework divides the whole features into small tasks. And the team execute those tasks in short sprints. Each time you move the post-it card from _In Progress_ to _Done,_ you&#39;ll get a dopamine shot. Each time the team done presenting the sprint in the evaluation (aka Sprint demo), each member of the team will get dopamine shots.

Scrum helps the development team to keep having the feeling that small part of the job is done each time. That&#39;s also why we often want to formulate the tasks to be small, small enough to be done in a working day, so you&#39;ll get your daily dopamine dose.

**3)Serotonin**, the approval hormone, the thing you get for feeling being approved by others. There&#39;s no title within the development team, if you play Scrum by the book. These titles don&#39;t exist within the team: _team leader_, _tester,_ or _chief architect_ within the team. You don&#39;t need to have an approval for a _title_ nor you have to feel insignificant because you&#39;re the one who&#39;s just graduated yesterday.

Each member is approved for what he/she has contributed in every day&#39;s tasks. The whole team will feel _approved_ when their work is being appreciated on the last day&#39;s demo.

**4)Oxytocin**, the thing you get for feeling loved, and trusted. In Scrum we learn that the stories in the sprint are listed according to the priority. The whole team will strive to get the first story done before starting the next one. Scrum _forces_ the team to work together by all means.

The daily stand-ups are not _status report_. We don&#39;t report our activities, we rather put our ear wide open, and listen how we can be a service to others. By enforcing to work on one user story together, we kind of obligated to help each other. It will become a sort of _dilemma_, your favourite user story is the next one, but you can&#39;t start before the current one is done. To make it happen fast, you need to put your effort to help each other to get the one you&#39;re facing done.

Helping each other stimulates oxytocin shots, hence your happiness. Sinek&#39;s also mentioned that oxytocin is also contagious, just by observing anyone else helping others. It might be hard for a new Scrum team to build this kind of environment but it&#39;s the team&#39;s job to realize this atmosphere in the team. Once you have this, the productivity will explode.
