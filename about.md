Hi, I'm Ferry Utomo, a full-stack software developer with 20+ years of experience, specializing in C# and JavaScript/React.I achieved my master's degree in Computer Science at TU Delft in 2001. I immediately had different jobs as a software engineer. For 13 years I have worked in stock-brokerage which systems require a high level of accurateness and performance.

I am a person that feels uncomfortable being in my comfort zone. I continuously seek new ways to improve, for the benefit of the customers, for the colleagues, and for sure for myself. For this cause, I enjoy exploring new technologies and am looking forward to applying them.
